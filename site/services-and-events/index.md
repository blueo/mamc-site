  title: Sunday School
  content: "<p>The young people of Mount Albert Methodist are led by three women who
    bring their various creative gifts to illustrate Christian principles of good
    living and character to children who range in ages from 6 months to 15 years old.
    The tenets of Christianity are offered to the children, who can make their own
    choices in consultation with their parents regarding what it should mean to them.
    The children regularly lead church services, and design their contributions themselves
    guided by the Sunday School teachers. We enjoy music, and sing Christian songs-
    usually accompanied by guitar.</p>"
