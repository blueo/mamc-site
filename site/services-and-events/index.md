  title: Children at MAMC
  content: "<p>The young people of Mount Albert Methodist are led by volunteers who
    bring their various creative gifts to illustrate Christian principles and texts
    to children from 0 to18 years of age. The tenets of Christianity are offered to
    the children, who can make their own choices in consultation with their parents
    regarding what these should mean to them. The children regularly lead church services,
    and design their contributions themselves guided by the Sunday School teachers.
    Younger children are able to play in the cr√®che area with puzzles, books, and
    colouring-in equipment during the first half of the service, and then all go out
    to their activites during the second half. These activities are held both together
    and divided into Senior, Junior, and Infants classes. Nappy change facilities
    are located in the unisex bathroom in the church foyer.</p>"
