  title: About the choir
  content: <p>Our enthusiastic and accomplished choir conductor, Mark Rosser, encourages
    a motley band of talented amateurs to perform works such as Johannes Brahms ‘Requiem’,
    Andrew Carter ‘Benedicite’, Camille Saint-Saëns ‘Oratorio de Noël’, Felix Mendelssohn
    ‘Elijah’, and many, many others. The choir is a high quality but relaxed and welcoming
    ensemble that provides spiritual support for the congregation and has fun doing
    so - and miraculously they (almost) always sound great! You can view some of the
    choir's performances on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwCPNr66rHNgcVpTnVaxLnA"
    title="">this youtube channel</a>, and some of our virtual performaces recorded
    during 2020 Covid-19 lockdowns on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJqs3opC3b2IggMFlhtZ9rQ/featured"

    meets for rehearsal on Wednesday nights from 7.30 – 9.00pm</strong></p><p>There
