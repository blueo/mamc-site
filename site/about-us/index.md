  content: "<p>The Mount Albert Methodist Church has many opportunities for Christian
    service within the church, and in outreach to the community. We can contribute
    to a foodbank, volunteer for the Community Club that meets in our Church Hall,
    sing in the choir, arrange flowers, mow lawns, and participate or help organise
    various fund raising events. For a time the church needs to invest in routine
    maintenance, but once these tasks are completed we expect to be able to use our
    various skills and talents to raise money for other causes thoughtfully considered
    to be worthy.</p>"
