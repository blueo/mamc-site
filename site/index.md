  title: About our Church
  content: The agitation and tears which the subject occasioned, brought on a headache;
    and it grew so much worse towards the evening, that, added to her unwillingness
    to see Mr. Darcy, it determined her not to attend her cousins to Rosings, where
    they were engaged to drink tea. Mrs. Collins, seeing that she was really unwell,
    did not press her to go and as much as possible prevented her husband from pressing
    her; but Mr. Collins could not conceal his apprehension of Lady Catherineâ€™s being
    rather displeased by her staying at home.
