  title: About our Church
  content: "<p>Mount Albert Methodist Church is a friendly, welcoming congregation
    who meet together on Sunday mornings at 10 am. We worship God through music, acclamation
    through the sharing of a liturgy, fellowship, and teaching from Reverend Amos
    Muzondiwa and several guest speakers from within our congregation and invited
    from other churches and Christian organisations. We have an active Sunday School,
    four part Choir which gives regular concerts, and we are starting a Christian
    book club in the New Year. We would welcome you as part of our church family when
    you visit us - with a shared cup of tea or coffee after the service.</p><p>Mount
    Albert Methodist supports various socially supportive community groups who meet
    regularly in our Church Hall. We also share support of the Beneficiaries Advocacy
    Mt Albert (BAMA) with St Luke’s Anglican Church. BAMA provides financial advice
    to beneficiaries.</p><p>Our church celebrated its 150th year of service to the
    community in 2016, and is now 154 years old.</p>"
