  title: Mount Albert Methodist Church Choir
  content: Our enthusiastic and accomplished choir conductor, Mark Rosser, encourages
    a motley band of talented amateurs to perform works such as Johannes Brahms ‘Requiem’,
    Andrew Carter ‘Benedicite’, Camille Saint-Saëns ‘Oratorio de Noël’, Felix Mendelssohn
    ‘Elijah’, and many, many others! The choir is a high quality but relaxed and welcoming
    ensemble that provides spiritual support for the congregation and has fun doing
    so.
